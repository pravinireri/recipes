        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
            <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
            <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
